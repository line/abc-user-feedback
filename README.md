## Getting Started

The frontend is built with NextJS and the backend is built with NestJS. We provide Docker images for fast and easy setup.

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

**Required**

- [Node.js v20 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [MySQL v8](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

**Optional**

- SMTP - for mail verification during making accounts
- [OpenSearch v7](https://opensearch.org/) - for performance on searching feedback

You can use [docker-compose.infra.yml](/docker/docker-compose.infra.yml) file for requirements.

### Docker Hub Images

We publish two images to https://hub.docker.com at every release.

#### [Web Admin Frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/line/abc-user-feedback-web)

```bash
docker pull line/abc-user-feedback-web
```

#### [API Backend](https://hub.docker.com/r/line/abc-user-feedback-api)

```bash
docker pull line/abc-user-feedback-api
```

### Configuration

**Frontend**

:point_right: [Go to Frontend README](./apps/web/README.md)

You can configure the frontend for session password, maximum time span to query, etc.

**Backend**

:point_right: [Go to Backend README](./apps/api/README.md)

You can configure the backend for MySQL, SMTP for email verification, OpenSearch-powered improved search experience, etc.

## Setup Dev Environment (Local)

ABC User Feedback is using a monorepo (powered by [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/)) with multiple apps and packages.

Follow the instructions below to set up a local development environment.

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/line/abc-user-feedback
cd abc-user-feedback
pnpm install
```

2. Spin up all required infrastructure (Mysql, OpenSearch, etc.) using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
```

3. Make an `.env` file in `apps/api` and `apps/web` by referring to `.env.example` ([web environment variables](./apps/web/README.md), [api environment variables](./apps/api/README.md))

4. Apply database migrations:

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run migration:run
```

5. To start developing, run the `dev` target of both of apps in root directory:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Also, you can run the `dev` target of one of apps in root directory:

```bash
# web
pnpm turbo run dev --filter=web

# api
pnpm turbo run dev --filter=api
```

### ADMIN WEB GUIDE

For detailed information on using the admin web interface, please refer to our [Admin Web Guide](./GUIDE.md).
