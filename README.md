# Features

ABC User Feedback provides the following features:

- Dynamic Feedback Field
- Feedback Tagging
- Addon Issue tracking
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Admin UI

# Getting Started

You can get started with Docker image on your server.

Alternatively you can set up a local development environment.

## 1. Official Docker Image Installation

### [web](https://hub.docker.com/r/line/abc-user-feedback-web)

```
docker pull line/abc-user-feedback-web
```

### [api](https://hub.docker.com/r/line/abc-user-feedback-api)

```
docker pull line/abc-user-feedback-api
```

## 2. Development Environment (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

#### Required

- [Node.js v18 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [MySQL v8](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

#### Optional

- SMTP - for mail verification during making accounts
- [OpenSearch v7](https://opensearch.org/) - for performance on searching feedbacks

You can use [docker-compose.infra.yml](./docker-compose.infra.yml) file for requirements.

### Getting Started With Local Development

ABC User Feedback is using a monorepo (powered by [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/)) with multiple apps and packages.

Follow these simple instructions to set up a local development environment.

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/line/abc-user-feedback
cd abc-user-feedback
yarn install
```

2. Spin up all required infrastructure (Mysql, Opensearch, etc.) using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
```

3. Make an `.env` file in `apps/api` and `apps/web` by referring to `.env.example` ([web environment variables](./apps/web/README.md), [api environment variables](./apps/api/README.md))

4. Apply database migrations:

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run migration:run
```

5. To start developing, run the `dev` target of both of apps in root directory:

```bash
yarn dev
```

6. Also, you can run the `dev` target of one of apps in root directory:

```bash
# web
yarn turbo run dev --filter=web

# api
yarn turbo run dev --filter=api
```

You can always find more information in each app/library's respective README.md file.

### Setting Up ABC User Feedback Manually

You can use a manual step-by-step approach to set up ABC User Feedback in a local development environment. To do so, you should follow the following instructions for **Setting Up ABC User Feedback Server**, and **Setting Up ABC User Feedback Client**.

#### Setting up [ABC User Feedback Server](./apps/api/README.md)

ABC User Feedback Server is built with the following awesome open-source technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Typeorm, and many more.

#### Setting Up [ABC User Feedback Client](./apps/web/README.md)

ABC User Feedback Client is the front end of the platform that provides you with an easy-to-drive UI for building your next low-code application.
The client is based on React, React Hook Form, React Query, Tailwind css, MUI, and more.

### Build Docker Image

For your code build, you can buile docker image using docker-compose. Please refer to [remote caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) and [deploying with docker](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/deploying-with-docker) using turborepo

```
docker-compose build
```

Then, run docker-compose

```
docker-compose up -d
```
