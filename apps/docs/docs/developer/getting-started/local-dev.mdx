## Setup Dev Environment using Command Line Tool

ABC User Feedback supports a command line tool (`auf-cli`) that easily runs both the frontend and backend.

With this tool, you can initialize the infrastructure and run the app using a pre-configured Docker image. Since the CLI is executable with `npx`, only an `npm` environment is required, with no additional dependencies.

```bash
npx auf-cli init # initialize infrastructure
npx auf-cli start # start app
npx auf-cli stop # stop app
```
