# How to contribute to ABC User Feedback

First of all, thank you so much for taking your time to contribute! ABC User Feedback is not very different from any other open source projects. It will be fantastic if you help us by doing any of the following:

- File an issue in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/line/abc-user-feedback/issues)
  to report bugs and propose new features and improvements.
- Ask a question using [the issue tracker](https://github.com/line/abc-user-feedback/issues).
- Contribute your work by sending [a pull request](https://github.com/line/abc-user-feedback/pulls).
- You should make your pull request base branch as `dev` not `main`. After merging to `dev` branch, we test the pull request in our separate environment and if there is no issue, it would be merged to `main` and released.

## Contributor license agreement

If you are sending a pull request and it's a non-trivial change beyond fixing
typos, please make sure to sign the [ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement)](https://cla-assistant.io/line/abc-user-feedback).
Please [contact us](mailto:dl_oss_dev@linecorp.com) if you need the CCLA (Corporate Contributor License Agreement).

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to follow [our code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
